Pirate is your own <strong>Personal Web App (PWA)</strong> 
It works on any device - NO App Store needed.

Watch ad-free videos, edit your homepage, update your profile, and publish engaging content with YOU maintaining FULL ownership and copyright control.

Pirate is also a new social media.  Using a decentralized network of other Pirate websites, YOU control the algorithm, not some corporation.

Using open-source platforms, Pirate operates forever, with no contracts, commitments or costs of any kind.
